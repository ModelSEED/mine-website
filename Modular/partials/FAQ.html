<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h4>How do you generate <i>in silico</i> metabolites?</h4>
<div class="well">
    These compounds are generated from hand-curated reaction rules generalized form chemistry according to the Enzyme
    Commission classification system. For more information please refer to:
</div>

<h4>Why don't the compounds database include stereochemistry?</h4>
<div class="well">
    BNICE does not handle chirality currently. As such, where multiple stereoisomers of a structure exist, the MINE
    entry will include information on all of the isomers.
</div>

<h4>How can I integrate your database into my tool/pipeline?</h4>
<div class="well">
    We offer client APIs in JavaScript, Python and Perl which cover all the functionality of this website. Please
        <a href="mailto:minedatabasescontact@gmail.com?Subject=Client%20request" target="_top"> contact us</a>
    to request the most recent version. Alternatively, you may request all the unannotated(license restrictions, sorry)
    structures as a SDF file.
</div>

<h4>I found an error/ I'm skeptical about the validity of a compound</h4>
<div class="well">
    We would love to hear about it. Please let us know by sending an email to
        <a href="mailto:minedatabasescontact@gmail.com?" target="_top"> minedatabasescontact@gmail.com</a>
    and let us know. If reproting a bug, please include information as to how the error was generated.
